# code scanner

Code Scanner is a helpful application which can be used on any platform using the kivy framework. It is made for students and instructors to help convert images of programming language code in languages such as C from notebooks as well as textbooks.

The app allows the user to click an image from their smart phones, converts the image to text using OCR by the pytesseract module available in python. The app then compiles, runs and displays the output of the code.
